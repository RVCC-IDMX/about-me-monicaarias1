Hi, I'm Monica Arias, and I'm excited to talk about learning web development. I've learned everything from the basics to the specific details of coding and design. During the course, I didn't just learn theory, I got hands on with practical skills. I made my very first webpage from scratch. It was awesome to see my ideas turn into something real using code. One of the best parts of learning was discovering how flexible web development can be. I figured out how to add images, colors, and videos to my webpage, making it pop. Each thing I added made it better and more functional. I also learned about making websites easy to use for everyone. It's important that everyone can navigate a site easily, no matter who they are. I'm still learning, but I'm pumped to keep exploring web development!
